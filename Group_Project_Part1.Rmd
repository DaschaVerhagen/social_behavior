# Conditioning is selecting based on a criteria and intervening is forcing the entire population. We chose to intervene on gender because we know that gender impacts both education level and financial earnings. Both of these factors impact an individual's decision-making process. For example, women typically earn less than men, but more women are studying at institutions of higher learning.
